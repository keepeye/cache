It supports diffrent drivers.

=======

        composer require keepeye/cache

2. just look:

        <?php
        include "vendor/autoload.php";
        //first you should make a instance of cacheManager
        $cacheManager = new Keepeye\Cache\Cache;
        //get a instance of driver through cacheManager with some options
        $cache = $cacheManager->getInstance(array(
            "dir" => __DIR__."/cache"
        ));
        //store an item in the cache for 600 seconds.
        $cache->put("k1","v1",600);
        //retrieve an item by key
        $cache->get("k1");//output "v1"
        //remove an item
        $cache->forget("k1");
        $cache->get("k1");//get null
        //remove all
        $cache->fush();
